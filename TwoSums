# Leetcode - Problem 1: Two Sums
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.

# Time and Space complexity: O(n) 
# Written in Python3

class Solution:
# Define variables and hashmap
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashmap = {}
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            hashmap[nums[i]] = i

# For loop using x = target - num to determine values that equal target.
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in hashmap and hashmap[complement] != i:
                return [i, hashmap[complement]]
